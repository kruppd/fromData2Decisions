# The Value of Collecting and Visualizing Bird Activity Data

### The Importance of Collecting Data About Environmental Concerns

Every year people are keenly aware of the changing seasons. Each day, weather and climate influences billions of decisions around the world. A farmer’s livelihood may depend on having enough precipitation in the growing season. A poor prediction on a hurricane path may endanger the lives from communities that did not evacuate. 

Although the common concerns of weather have not changed much over the years, the human population has grown to over 7.5 billion (U.S. and World Population Clock, 2018). This unprecedented global population growth has led modern scientists and policymakers to ask an important question, what is the human impact on the environment and climate? A researcher trying to answer this question and provide physical evidence of causation with the degree of impact is no easy task.

The complexity of our world should not be underestimated, especially when considering the intricacy of even the most fundamental biological systems and processes. Many factors and variables exist, and it’s a challenge to answer even simple climate questions without relying on certain assumptions or potentially unreliable predictive models. Using recent methods to collect, analyze, and visualize actual data, we can only help improve our understanding about these important climate and environmental questions.

### Potential Benefits from Tracking Animal Behavior and Decisions

Throughout history, animals have supplemented human activities in various tasks, due to our natural weaknesses in different physical areas. Horseback riding is obviously much more efficient than walking to your destination by foot. For research purposes, the greater interest is on animal behaviors and habits. Animals have natural perceptions that can alert and aid humans about subtle changes taking place within different situations and environments (Hayakawa, 2013, p. 20).

For example, dogs aid people in many activities that require heighted senses, like helping people with certain disabilities, following a scent of missing people, or protecting a house from stealthy intrusions. Attempting to better understand these perceptive abilities, a scientific study tested the reactions of dogs to numeracy awareness, different physical objects, 2D images, human face recognition, human voice recognition, and human expression understanding (Winters, Dubuc, & Higham, 2015, p. 629).

Other popular subjects for studying animal perceptions include primates and dolphins (Winters, Dubuc, & Higham, 2015, p. 629), likely due to their intelligence. Instead of studying what animals are actually sensing, animal tracking simply looks for changes in behavior with location data. A common research question in this area is tracking odd animal behavior before earthquakes (Hayakawa, 2013, p. 20). Tracking the reactions of animal populations with data has many exciting applications that could possibly be used to alert us of both natural and unnatural environmental disasters.

With the recent advances of big data, scientists are now able to place advanced sensors on animals to collect new sources of data. Similar to modern unmanned aerial vehicle concepts, many animals can broadcast information from environments that are difficult or dangerous for humans to work. For example, scientists have placed sensors on narwhals, which is a type of whale, for measuring water temperature around Greenland (Popescu, 2017). Animals are able to provide researchers even more information than what an unmanned vehicle can offer, because we can collect data showing us how animals naturally react to the changes occurring within their environments.

Animal decisions and reactions are influenced from their natural senses and perceptions, but how these decisions are actually being made efficiently, concerning individual or group preservation, is generally not known (de Froment, Rubenstein, & Levin, 2014, p. 2). Analysis on animal perception and decision-making could be used to build our understanding on changes occurring in different environments, and how these changes are impacting different animal species and populations.

Tracking animal activities could eventually allow researchers to be aware of environmental problems much earlier with better diagnoses. With the right systems in place, a near-real time look at the data could enable an early-warning system to wildfires, poaching, disease, or other potential issues that adversely impact the size of animal populations. In addition, tracking the populations of endangered species with more timely and accurate data could help us manage populations back to recovery and growth.

Collecting detailed information on animal activity could eventually help policymakers develop stronger regulations with higher standards of conduct for both businesses and individuals. This information could suggest changes to human activities in a way that avoids harming certain environments with more actionable and targeted prevention strategies. Having credible data with compelling analysis provides important evidence that could have major impacts on public opinion, legal cases, city permitting, and risk management.

### Potential Benefits from Tracking Bird Behavior and Decisions

Bird migration could become an important source of physical evidence for future research on changes in the climate. With recent advances in big data, this period is an opportune time to explore bird migration patterns. Researchers have many new possibilities with artificial intelligence and data visualization to explore data records on bird migration patterns (Jiao, Huettmann, Guoc, Lid, & Ouyange, 2016).

Analyzing data from transmitters on bird populations could potentially allow scientists to track millions of decisions being made by birds every day. The main concerns from telemetry studies on birds are costs, small-sample sizes, and accurately representing variation when describing population activities (Lamb, Satge, Fiorello, & Jodice, 2017, p. 618). Although some concerns exist that banding, and tagging could affect individual behaviors, adding transmitters did not greatly affect longer-term pelican behavior, but it was also recommended that more research was needed (Lamb, Satge, Fiorello, & Jodice, 2017, pp. 625-626). It’s a good idea to be aware of the potential effects of transmitters might have on different bird species, especially with smaller-sized birds.

Before bird researchers had access to this more advanced sensor technology, bird banding was the classic method to track bird activity with simple identification tags (Jiao, Huettmann, Guoc, Lid, & Ouyange, 2016). Even with lower-tech methods, data from bird banding can be quite extensive, although data quality issues were far greater (Bystrak, Nakash, & Lutmerding, 2012, pp. 13-14). The island of Hegoland in the North Sea started the practice of tracking bird migrations in 1909, which has provided nearly 1 million observations from bird captures in the last 109 years (Hüppop & Hüppop, 2011). Bird banding is a manual process with many different options in band materials used (Carroll, Hamm, Hagen, Davis, & Guthery, 2017, pp. 2-6). In designated areas, birds are captured in hidden traps at regular intervals. These regular intervals ensure consistency when capturing different birds. Data is often manually entered, which logs individual bird details (Bystrak, Nakash, & Lutmerding, 2012, p. 13).

Collecting data over a long period of time allows researchers to analyze the trends and patterns. Anomalies may alert to possible changes to migration patterns or the general health of each specie. When changes are discovered, then researchers can investigate possible factors, like a disruption with the food supply.

### Potential Benefits from Visualizing Bird Activity

Modern data visualization approaches and techniques can add value to bird migration analysis and research by creating more engaging visual experiences. This engagement can support greater understanding and interest by policymakers, researchers, and the general public. Especially for data visualizations that support scientific research, accuracy and objectivity are essential. 

A common concern about the field of statistics is someone can easily pass misleading results to an unsuspecting audience (Ekman, 2013, p. 27). With data visualization, these concerns can be even greater. Since data visualizations are often graphically easier to understand and more engaging, a well-designed data visualization can build trust with an audience, even if the underlying information is suspect (Allen, Erhardt, & Calhoun, 2012, p. 63). Cherry-picking observations or scaling data inappropriately can lead to inaccurate analysis and predictions.

Although we still rely on the ethics and thorough documentation from researchers, combining newer data visualization approaches with traditional statistical methods could help reduce errors. Data visualizations can be used to help researchers see the data to supplement the more mathematical approaches to summarizing data. Anscombe’s Quartet is a reminder on the importance of visualizing data in a disaggregate view instead of solely relying on quantitative summaries and models (Anscombe, 1973). Statistical summaries and aggregations can hide or overlook data quality issues or cause a misinterpretation of the data. By confirming results with both statistical methods and visual analysis, it would likely lead to greater accuracy.

Statisticians are beginning to explore other aspects of statistical data-quality beyond accuracy, like meeting user needs and user satisfaction (Šķiltere & Jesiļevska, 2014, pp. 425-426). Beyond preventing data errors, data visualizations can help researchers better understand their audiences to improve the effectiveness of their visual communication.

Data visualization has become a popular approach for sharing information in a more compelling way. If bird researchers can demonstrate what types of analyses and data visualizations are possible with bird banding data, then it could encourage other animal specialists to improve their data collection methods and visual communication capabilities.
